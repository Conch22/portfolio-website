    content: |-
      I am a senior Biomedical Engineering student at Case Western Reserve University, with a focus on biomechanics. 
      
      I am currently a co-op student at Innovative Delta Technology, developing surgical instruments and implants for spinal surgery. I have also been involved in neural engineering research at the APT Center, developing low-level impedance control and the mechanical structure of a powered prosthetic leg. I am also the Logistics Lead for CWRU Motorsports, where I mainly facilitate organization-wide management of our equipment, tools, and vehicles.
